I just completed JPMorgan Chase's Investment Banking on Forage. In the simulation I:
Identified an ideal M&A target for a client based on an assessment of their strategic and financial criteria.
Constructed a DCF model to calculate the valuation of the M&A target and adjusted the model to account for a competitor bid and supply chain interruption.
Created a 2-pager for the client containing a company profile and summary of the auction process.
